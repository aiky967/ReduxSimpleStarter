# ReduxSimpleStarter

### Getting started
This is a youtube player web application. I used all the latest library as the old ones given by StephenGrider was not working.

To run this project follow this command ->

```
> git clone -b master https://github.com/aiky967/ReduxSimpleStarter
> cd ReduxSimpleStarter
> npm install
> npm start
```
I also deployed it in public server -> https://aiky-youtube.netlify.app/
